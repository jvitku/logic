This is a part of Hybrid Artificial Neural Network Systems (HANNS) project (see: http://artificiallife.co.nf ). 

This ROS metapackage (currently without direct catkin support) is a collection of ROS(java) nodes which implement some logical operations; from simple logic gates towards the more complex ones.

Each node can be connected into a potentially heterogeneous network of nodes communicating via the ROS, potentially Nengoros ( nengoros.wordpress.com ).
